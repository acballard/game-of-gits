House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to
begin, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!

Then Rick cloned Joffrey and killed him again over and over for a thousand years.

Rick decided a thousand years was good enough. Alex resumed killing Joffrey for the following thousand years.

We figured it out - so we killed them all.
